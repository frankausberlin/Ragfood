      When working with Jupyter notebooks:
      
      1. **Notebook JSON Format Handling:**
      - Always use write_to_file for major notebook restructuring rather than apply_diff
      - Remember that .ipynb files are JSON with specific cell structure
      - Be careful with line numbers when using apply_diff on notebooks
      
      2. **nbdev Workflow Best Practices:**
      - Always run `nbdev_clean` before committing to strip outputs
      - Use `nbdev_export` to sync notebooks with library code
      - Check `settings.ini` for proper dependency configuration
      - Use `nbdev_install_hooks` for automatic pre-commit cleaning
      
      3. **GitHub Actions Debugging:**
      - Focus on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" success over CI test failures
      - Look for "unstripped notebooks" and "not in sync" error messages
      - Check for missing dependencies in requirements line
      - Use browser-mcp to navigate GitHub Actions logs systematically
      
      4. **Widget and Testing Issues:**
      - ipywidgets don't work in headless CI environments
      - Create separate test files for CI compatibility
      - Use environment detection (CI=true, GITHUB_ACTIONS=true) to skip widget tests
      - Consider mock objects for widget testing in CI
      
      5. **Common nbdev CI Fixes:**
      - Add missing dependencies to settings.ini requirements
      - Simplify complex docstrings that cause parsing errors
      - Remove or hide problematic cells with #| hide directive
      - Ensure proper cell execution order and imports
      
      Always verify fixes by pushing changes and checking both CI and deployment status.
