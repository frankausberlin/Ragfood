### Colleague

>  Colleague (mediator)

\*Base class for colleagues in the mediator pattern.

Colleagues are objects that communicate with each other through a
mediator rather than directly. This promotes loose coupling and
centralized communication control.

Attributes: mediator: The mediator object that handles communication\*

### Mediator

>  Mediator ()

\*Base mediator class that coordinates communication between colleagues.

The mediator pattern defines how a set of objects interact with each
other. Instead of objects communicating directly, they communicate
through the mediator, which handles the interaction logic.

This base class must be subclassed to implement specific mediation
logic.\*

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a concrete example showing how to use the mediator pattern:

``` python
class ConcreteColleague(Colleague):
    """Example colleague implementation for demonstration."""
    
    def __init__(self, mediator):
        """Initialize colleague and notify mediator of creation.
        
        Args:
            mediator: The mediator to communicate through
        """
        super().__init__(mediator)
        # Notify mediator that this colleague was created
        self.changed('OnColleagueCreate', 0, 'firstPositional', second='with_keywords')
    
    def work(self, *argc, **argv):
        """Perform work and notify the mediator.
        
        Args:
            *argc: Positional arguments to pass to mediator
            **argv: Keyword arguments to pass to mediator
        """
        # Notify mediator about work being performed
        self.changed('OnColleagueWork', 1, *argc, **argv)

class ConcreteMediator(Mediator):
    """Example mediator implementation that manages two colleagues."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize mediator and create colleague instances."""
        # Create colleagues that will communicate through this mediator
        self.colleagueA = ConcreteColleague(self)
        self.colleagueB = ConcreteColleague(self)
    
    def working(self, *argc, **argv):
        """Coordinate work between colleagues.
        
        Args:
            *argc: Arguments to pass to colleagues
            **argv: Keyword arguments to pass to colleagues
        """
        # Trigger work in both colleagues
        self.colleagueA.work('A')
        self.colleagueB.work(work='second')
    
    def notify(self, colleague, event, state, *argc, **argv):
        """Handle notifications from colleagues by printing debug info.
        
        In a real implementation, this would contain logic to coordinate
        between colleagues based on the events they report.
        
        Args:
            colleague: The colleague that sent the notification
            event (str): The event type
            state: The state information
            *argc: Additional positional arguments
            **argv: Additional keyword arguments
        """
        print(event, state, argc, argv)

# Demonstrate the mediator pattern
cm = ConcreteMediator()
cm.working()
```
